* TODO Add alternate RESPONSE blocks for the EscapeAreaObjectMove relocation
This could make it somewhat interesting for players, if the npcs
walked off to random spots from a set of potential locs, vs going to
the same one every time.

* TODO Faction tracking among individual npcs
We could allow responses to control how much one likes the charname,
or just do a more generic dialogue chain, where the player can go into
a friendship path, or reject it outright.
